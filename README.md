## Project 1 - Explanatory Data Analysis & Data Presentation with Movies Dataset

### Budget

From the dataset, the average budget for each year was calculated. It can be seen a very sharp growth from the 1980s, with the peak in the 2000s. After that, there is a brief period of decline followed by a new boom.
